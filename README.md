Adjusted tunnel distance is the distance away from the plate when a pitch deviates more than a ball's diameter from the pitch before in location at a certain point in time. 

A higher TNL Value indicates that a pitcher does a better job at "tunneling" their pitches. TNL value is a calculated value based on normalizing the data and creating a statistical model to predict  TNL score based off of pitch trajectory deviations.
